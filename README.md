# Chess

## Description
This project is essentially a re-creation of the popular board game, chess, from scratch other than the single player engine. It first started as a final project for a coding class, but new features were constantly added and grew entirely past the scope of the project. I had a lot of fun making this to please feel free to check it out!

## Usage
Download all neccesary files (pip install requirements.txt) and run the main.py file contained in src.

## Features
### Basic Features
The program has many similar features to a typical chess website. For example, it has all chess logic including piece movement, capturing, promotions, castleing, en pessant, etc. It also has commonly seen visual features like a board, pieces, legal piece moves, check warnings, and promotion menus.

### Modes
The program features one and two player modes. If two player is selected, user(s) can take turns making moves on the same device. f one player mode is selected, the user will have the opportunity to choose which color they want to play with, and get to play against the wellknown stockfish chess engine. **Keep in mind the engine makes the best possible move so don't feel bad when you lose!** The engine will automatically make a move after the user makes a move.

### Controls
The game is mainly played through clicking on a piece you want to move, then clicking on the square you want to move it to. Users can also use the arrow keys to check previous board states. Left arrow key shows previous boards and right arrow key brings users back to the current board.
