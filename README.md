# Chess

## Description
This project is essentially a re-creation of the popular board game, chess, from scratch other than the single player engine. It first started as a final project for a coding class, but new features were constantly added and grew entirely past thee scope of the project. I had a lot of fun making this to please feel free to check it out!

## 

## Usage
Simply download all neccesary files (fonts, images, src, stockfish) and run the main.py file contained in src.

## Features
The program has many similar features to a typical chess website. Besides the standard chess logic along with the visual representation of the board, the program also features easy to see warnings when one's king is in check along with an easy to navigate menu that pops up during pawn promotion. A simple message will also appear when the game is over.

The program also features one and two player modes. If one player mode is selected, the user will have the opportunity to choose which color they want to play with, and get to play against the wellknown stockfish chess engine. **Keep in mind the engine makes the best possible move so don't feel bad when you lose!**
